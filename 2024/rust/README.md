# My solutions for Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

## Setup

Make sure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Run an example

To run an example, you can simply run:
```shell
cargo run -- <day> <task> -e <example_id>
```
The double-dash between `run` and the arguments is important. For example, if you want to run the first example for day 13 task 2, you would enter

```shell
cargo run -- 13 2 -e 1
```

## Run a solution

To run a solution, you can simply leave out the `-e <example_id>`:
```shell
cargo run -- <day> <task>
```
The double-dash between `run` and the arguments is important. For example, if you want to run the solution for day 16 task 1, you would enter

```shell
cargo run -- 16 1
```

## Future directions

1. Adding unittests
2. Adding timing information
