# My solution for Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for AoCs. I started participating in 2021. Each directory contains further instructions how to setup the environment to run the solutions.

## Programming languages
Early on, I only used Python, but in later years, I tried out other programming languages. You can find an overview below:

| Year | Language(s) |
|------|-------------|
| [2021](./2021) | Python |
| [2022](./2022) | Python |
| [2023](./2023) | Python, some in Go |
| [2024](./2024) | Rust, except for a single Python solution |

Each directory contains its own (maybe short) README with further instructions, how to set up the environment.
