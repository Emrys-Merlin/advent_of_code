# My solutions for Advent of Code 2025

I decided to learn [Haskell](https://haskell.org/) with this year's AoC. Expect most solutions to be in Haskell. If I am very tight on time, I might resort to Python, but I try to avoid it.

## Solutions

| Day | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Task 01 | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Task 02 | | | | | | | | | | | | |

## Structure

- [`examples`](./examples) contains the examples as separate files. The file names follow the format `day{day:02d}_{counter:02d}.txt`
- [`inputs`](./inputs) the same for the inputs, but without the counter, i.e., `day{day:02d}.txt`.
- The other directories are named after a programming language and contain the solutions to AoC in that programming language. This year, there is a [`Haskell`](./haskell) and (potentially) a [`python`](./python) directory. The READMEs in each directory tell you how to run the solutions.
